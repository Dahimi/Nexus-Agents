## **Current Agents in the Hub**

We've kickstarted the hub with several foundational agents. While these initial implementations are still in early stages, they serve as starting points for community improvements.

### Recently Landed Agents

#### 1. Web Searcher Agent [STABLE]
- **Task Type**: `WEB_SEARCH`
- **Status**: Production Ready
- **Capabilities**:
  - Efficient web information retrieval
  - Query optimization
  - Result filtering and ranking
- **Evaluation Pipeline**: Complete
  - Comprehensive benchmark datasets
  - Implemented reward model
  - Performance metrics
  - CI/CD integration

#### 2. CLI Agent [IN PROGRESS]
```python
# Example usage of CLI Agent
query = "Create a new directory called 'projects' and initialize a git repo"
result = cli_agent.execute(query)
```
- **Task Type**: `CLI_COMMAND`
- **Status**: Basic Implementation
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Executes shell commands
  - Handles file and directory operations
  - Manages system commands
- **Needs Community Help With**:
  - Command validation and security
  - Error handling
  - Performance optimization
  - Evaluation pipeline

#### 3. Web Browser Agent [EXPERIMENTAL]
- **Task Type**: `WEB_BROWSER`
- **Status**: Early Development
- **Target Capabilities**:
  - Complex web interactions
  - Form filling and submissions
  - Browser navigation
  - Tasks like flight booking, platform sign-ups
- **Current Challenges**:
  - Stability issues
  - Performance optimization needed
  - Reliability improvements required
  - No evaluation pipeline yet

### Supported Task Types
Our platform aims to support the following task types:
```python
TaskTypes = {
    "web_search": "Information retrieval from the web",
    "cli_command": "Command-line operations",
    "file_manipulation": "File system operations",
    "coder": "Code generation and modification",
    "orchestrator": "Task planning and coordination",
    "web_browser": "Complex web interactions"
}
```

### Current Status Summary
**[STABLE]**:
- Web Search Agent (with complete evaluation pipeline)

**[IN PROGRESS]**:
- CLI Agent (basic implementation)

**[EXPERIMENTAL]**:
- Web Browser Agent (needs significant work)

**[PLANNED]**:
- File Manipulation Agent
- Coder Agent

### Why Open Source Matters
This is exactly why we've made Agent Hub open source! We need the community's expertise to:
- Stabilize experimental agents
- Build robust evaluation pipelines
- Improve performance and reliability
- Create competing implementations

### Get Involved
Priority areas for contribution:
1. **Web Browser Agent**:
   - Stability improvements
   - Error handling
   - Performance optimization
   - Evaluation pipeline development

2. **CLI Agent**:
   - Security enhancements
   - Command validation
   - Benchmark creation
   - Evaluation pipeline

3. **New Agents**:
   - File Manipulation implementation
   - Coder agent development
   - Alternative implementations of existing agents
