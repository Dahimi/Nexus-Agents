# **Agent Hub: Open-Source Platform for Specialized AI Agents**

Anthropic recently introduced Computer Use - a groundbreaking capability that allows AI to interact with computers just like humans do, through viewing screens, moving cursors, and typing. While this opens up endless possibilities for AI automation, it currently faces some key limitations: high latency in interactions, significant cost due to token usage, and reliability issues especially for specialized tasks.

This is where our solution comes in. Instead of relying on one large model to handle all computer interactions, we're building an open-source ecosystem of specialized, lightweight agents. Each agent excels at one specific task - whether it's manipulating spreadsheets, handling CLI operations, or navigating web interfaces. Some agents are small, fine-tuned LLMs, while others are simply clever software engineering solutions, choosing the most efficient approach for each task rather than defaulting to vision-based interaction.

By making this platform open-source, we're creating a hub where developers can contribute their specialized agents, fostering continuous improvement and evolution. This community-driven approach ensures we're always pushing towards more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective computer automation.

## **Overview**

Agent Hub allows developers to submit specialized AI agents that can interact with computers in various ways. These agents can automate tasks such as:

- Web searches
- Code generation
- Command-line operations
- And more...

Once submitted, agents are automatically evaluated based on defined benchmarks and metrics, including accuracy, speed, memory usage, and robustness. The best-performing agents are showcased in a leaderboard, and the community can vote to highlight the most effective solutions for specific tasks.

---

## **Features**

- **Modular Agent System**: Agents are designed to be specialized for different tasks (e.g., web search, CLI).
- **Automatic Evaluation**: Submitted agents are automatically evaluated on predefined benchmarks.
- **Task-Specific Benchmarks**: Predefined datasets and queries for each agent type.
- **Metrics**: Evaluation based on multiple factors, such as accuracy, time-to-complete, memory footprint, and cost.
- **Community Voting**: Vote for the best agents and help others discover the top performers.
- **Leaderboard**: A dynamic ranking system for agents based on their evaluation results.
- **Open-Source**: Fully open-source and community-driven development.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Submitting an Agent**:
   - Developers submit their agents by creating a pull request to the `agents/` directory in this repository.
   - The agent must be accompanied by a description, expected input/output format, and any dependencies.

2. **Evaluation Process**:
   - Each agent is automatically evaluated through our evaluation pipeline, which runs the agent against predefined benchmarks.
   - The evaluation measures key metrics like **accuracy**, **execution time**, **memory usage**, and **cost** (e.g., token usage for LLM-based agents).
   - The results are stored, and the agent is ranked accordingly.

3. **Leaderboard**:
   - The top-performing agents are displayed on the leaderboard, allowing the community to quickly discover the best solution for any task.

4. **Community Voting**:
   - Users can vote for agents based on their experience and performance, influencing the rankings and showcasing the most useful agents.

## **Contributing**

We welcome contributions from the community! Here’s how you can contribute:

1. **Fork the repository**.
2. **Create a new agent** for a specific task (e.g., web search, code generation).
3. **Test your agent** against the predefined benchmark datasets.
4. **Submit your agent** via a pull request and provide details (e.g., description, dependencies, etc.).
5. **Monitor your agent’s performance** on the leaderboard and respond to community feedback.

### **Before submitting, ensure your agent:**
- Follows the submission format (including required metadata).
- Works correctly with the evaluation pipeline.
- Has adequate documentation for other users.

---

## **Evaluation Pipeline**

The evaluation pipeline automatically runs on every new agent submission. Here's how it works:

1. **Agent Validation**: The agent is first validated to ensure that it follows the expected format and dependencies.
2. **Benchmark Testing**: The agent is tested against predefined task-specific benchmarks (e.g., web search queries, code generation tasks).
3. **Metrics Collection**: Several metrics are measured, including:
   - **Accuracy**: How well does the agent perform the task?
   - **Time-to-Complete**: How long does it take for the agent to complete the task?
   - **Memory Usage**: How much memory does the agent consume during execution?
   - **Cost**: If applicable, how much does the agent cost to run (e.g., token usage for LLMs)?
4. **Ranking**: The agent is ranked based on these metrics, and the results are displayed on the leaderboard.

### **Supported Benchmarks:**
- Web Search Agents
- CLI Operation Agents
- Code Generation Agents
- (More benchmarks coming soon...)

## **Running the Evaluation Locally**

You can also run the evaluation pipeline locally if you want to test an agent before submitting it. Here's how to set it up:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/agent-hub.git
   cd agent-hub
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the evaluation for an agent:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_evaluation.py --agent <path-to-agent-directory>
   ```

4. View the results:
   The results will be saved in `evaluation/results/`, and you can view the metrics like accuracy, time, memory usage, etc.
