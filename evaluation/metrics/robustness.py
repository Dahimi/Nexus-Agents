    Not yet implemented. There is currently no standardized way to measure robustness
    of software and LLM workflows. This would require:
    
    - Measuring consistency across different inputs
    - Testing behavior under adversarial conditions
    - Evaluating performance with noisy/corrupted data
    - Assessing reliability over time and multiple runs
    - Quantifying sensitivity to input variations
    
    Future implementations should establish standard robustness metrics and benchmarks.
