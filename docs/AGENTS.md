## Our Agent Ecosystem

### 🔍 Web Searcher Agent 🟢

Our flagship agent for intelligent web information retrieval.

**Core Features**
- 🎯 Smart query optimization
- 📊 Advanced result ranking
- 🔄 Efficient data filtering

**Implementation Status**

✅ Production-ready evaluation pipeline

✅ Comprehensive benchmarks

✅ CI/CD integration


### 💻 CLI Agent 🟡

Your command-line automation companion, featuring two complementary implementations:

**Standard Version**
- ⚡ Full-featured shell command execution
- 📁 Comprehensive file system operations
- 🛠️ Advanced system management capabilities
- 🧠 Built on established large-scale LLM

**Optimized Version (Our Innovation)**
- 🚀 Significantly faster inference on same hardware
- 💻 Hardware-friendly (20x+ smaller model)
- 🎯 Specialized for CLI operations
- 🔬 Knowledge distillation from larger model
- 🎓 Maintains high command accuracy

**Technical Implementation** 

While we initially explored advanced knowledge distillation approaches (MiniPLM and PromptKD), our implementation adapted to computational constraints:

- 📊 Base Model: Quantized Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B
- 🔧 Optimization: QLoRA fine-tuning using [`train.json`](train.json)
- 💡 Benefits: Reduced memory footprint while maintaining accuracy
